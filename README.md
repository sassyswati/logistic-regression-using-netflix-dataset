# logistic-regression-using-netflix-dataset 
Implemented logistic regression to develop a movie recommendation system using the Netflix dataset. 
Leveraged the power of machine learning to analyze user preferences and predict movie ratings. 
This project aimed to enhance the user experience and personalize 
movie recommendations on the Netflix platform. Gathered and preprocessed the Netflix dataset, consisting of millions of movie ratings and user profiles. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain
insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and
determine feature engineering strategies. Designed and implemented a logistic regression model
using Python's sci-kit-learn library to predict movie ratings.
